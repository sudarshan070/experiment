**A variable is used to store information that can be referenced later on.**

**Valid Python variable names**
Some characters are not allowed in a variable name; there are a few rules we need to abide by. Let’s start with the complete list of valid characters that can appear in a variable name:

Lowercase and uppercase letters: a-z and A-Z
Numbers: 0-9
Underscores: _
Additionally, there are these two rules:

* Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character and can not start with a number
* Names are case-sensitive
* Here are some valid variable names:

name_1,
name_2,
_database_connection
These are invalid names:

1tomany (don’t start with a number)
my-number (- is not allowed)
my number (spaces are not allowed)

**And these variables are not the same due to case sensitivity:**
